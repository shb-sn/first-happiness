# first-happiness
My first complex code in C++ which I ran successfully!
I learnt Python for 2 years in my 10+2 classes but I didn't do that much coding. Just the preliminary ones!
Now I am learning C++ codes and starting to code with C++.
Since I am a noob in this field, I request all the seniors and pros here to help me out!
This reposition is not something extra ordinary. Maybe I'll delete it later on!
It's just the start!
Happy coding to me!!
